    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I started my career as a design engineer, fresh out of engineering college—curious, hands-on, and eager to build. But I’ve always been drawn to the bigger picture: how processes work, why they matter, and how they impact people. That curiosity led me to pursue an MBA in Operations, and soon after, I found myself at an edtech startup, helping launch their new data science course. It was enriching to shape programs from scratch and enhance their operational efficiency. </p>
    <p>From there, I stepped into the world of financial services, joining Bajaj Finserv. I led digital products end-to-end, learned the nuances of fintech, and curiously worked on solving real problems for real users. That experience inspired me to go deeper into product management, earning my CSPO certification and sharpening my skills in strategy, collaboration, and execution.</p>
    <p>Today, I bring a blend of technical grounding, operational insight, and user empathy to every product I work on. I believe great products are built not just with data and design—but with purpose. Outside of work, I recharge by reading, traveling, and exploring new ideas that stretch my thinking.</p>
